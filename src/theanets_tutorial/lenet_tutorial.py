    # A few words on ``dimshuffle`` :
    #   ``dimshuffle`` is a powerful tool in reshaping a tensor;
    #   what it allows you to do is to shuffle dimension around
    #   but also to insert new ones along which the tensor will be
    #   broadcastable;
    #   dimshuffle('x', 2, 'x', 0, 1)
    #   This will work on 3d tensors with no broadcastable
    #   dimensions. The first dimension will be broadcastable,
    #   then we will have the third dimension of the input tensor as
    #   the second of the resulting tensor, etc. If the tensor has
    #   shape (20, 30, 40), the resulting tensor will have dimensions
    #   (1, 40, 1, 20, 30). (AxBxC tensor is mapped to 1xCx1xAxB tensor)
    #   More examples:
    #    dimshuffle('x') -> make a 0d (scalar) into a 1d vector
    #    dimshuffle(0, 1) -> identity
    #    dimshuffle(1, 0) -> inverts the first and second dimensions
    #    dimshuffle('x', 0) -> make a row out of a 1d vector (N to 1xN)
    #    dimshuffle(0, 'x') -> make a column out of a 1d vector (N to Nx1)
    #    dimshuffle(2, 0, 1) -> AxBxC to CxAxB
    #    dimshuffle(0, 'x', 1) -> AxB to Ax1xB
    #    dimshuffle(1, 'x', 0) -> AxB to Bx1xA
